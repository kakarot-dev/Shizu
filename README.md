**Shizu** is a stable bot which can be hosted on any os as long as that os has docker installed in it.

## Why should you invite Shizu?
[Shizu is a simple yet powerful Discord Bot that aims to give discord users an enhanced "Discord Experience".](https://dsc.gg/shizu)

Shizu can:
- Spice up chat environment with the use of roleplay/action commands such as pat, hug, slap, and more! </font> <br />
-  Search through the internet for information resources through various functions such as anime information lookup (series, characters, and even seiyuus!), games (via steam). </font> <br />
-  Ease the work of moderators by managing the server through various moderation commands. </font> <br />
-  Provide Airing Information automagically, and schedule message in various timezones. </font> <br />
-  Acquire totally random fun facts from various sources Shizu has access to. </font> <br />
-  Send a cute waifu everyday at 1:00 AM UTC to the channels you select. </font> <br />
-  Auto moderate users for mass mentioning and new line text ( more soon to be added ). [WIP] </font> <br />
-  Suggestion system toooo!!! </font> <br />


## Hosting on your self instance
